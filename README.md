- 👋 Hi, I’m @kadevohn
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a programmer and software engineer, someday.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the very basics of Python, although I have a long way to go. As of writing this on April 1 2021 I've only been learning the fundamentals for about 2 weeks.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing just yet, but soon!!!!
- 📫 How to reach me. email adress is kadevohn@gmail.com :D
